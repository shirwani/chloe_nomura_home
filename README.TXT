PAIR OF NIGHTSTANDS (WITH BASE IMAGES)

Imagine you are a seller on Facebook Marketplace. You have a pair of nightstands that you want to sell. Here is a picture containing both nightstands.
Generate an image in jpg format that you can use to create a listing. The images should feature the nightstands staged for sale. 
Use warm lighting for the image.

The image should show one of the nightstands in a scene next to a bed, against a plain wall. The color of the wall and the beddings should 
compliment the color of the nightstand.

IMPORTANT: Do not change anything about the nightstands themselves. They should remain exactly the same - pixel by pixel. This is important so that the 
images accurately represent the items for sale.

Generate a second image should show both nightstands side-by-side, against a wall with white wainscoting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate a third image should be a zoomed-in image for one of the nightstands, especially showing the details on the knob.
